## Stacks

A stack is a basic data structure where you can only insert or delete items at the top of the stack. It is kind of similar to a stack of books. If you want to look at a book in the middle of the stack you must take all of the books above it off first.

The stack is considered LIFO (Last In First Out) â€” meaning the last item you put in the stack is the first item that comes out of the stack
